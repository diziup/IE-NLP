These files are Add-ons to the MSTParser that could be found here:
http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~strctlrn/MSTParser/MSTParser.html

The file Statistics.java is new and the rest are existing files in the parser that were modified.
The functionally that was added is to be able to record different statistics from the parser, mainly the non-proj
mode, focusing on the cycles in the MST analysis.

The code is provided as is with no warranty. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
